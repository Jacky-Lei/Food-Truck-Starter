Born in Houston and raised in San Antonio, native Texan and 2012 Rising Star Chef Rene Ortiz spent two decades traveling the world, expanding his horizons and cultivating his international culinary skills. But like any good Texan, Ortiz eventually returned home.
      Ortiz began his culinary career in Vancouver, as chef de cuisine for Robert Clark at Star Anise, named “Canada's Best Restaurant of the Year” in 1996 by Gourmet Magazine. Ortiz went on to work his way through the brasseries and bistros of Western Europe, absorbing and exploring various culinary styles and pantries. By 1998, Ortiz found himself once again stateside, though still far from home, working under luminaries like Daniel Boulud, Alain Ducasse, and Jean-Louis Pallidan in New York City.",

      Chef John mastered Mandarin and Cantonese cuisines early on in his career. However, over time, his passion turned to the fiery chilis and spices of Szechuan cuisine, a style that he learned predominantly from the world renowned Master Chef and Culinary Teacher Zhongyi Liu. Chef John managed to coax Liu from the Grand Hotel in Beijing over a decade ago to assist him in re-launching his restaurant concept in Albany, California. Together they shared ideas and techniques and the outcome was a Szechuan inspired menu, prepared with time-honored technique using hand selected spices and chilis roasted in-house.",

The family owned and operated a fleet of fishing boats , made fish sauce, and grew coconuts. Thap-Sake is famous for their fine coconuts and the restaurant uses coconut milk produced in Thap-Sake. The rich red soil and tropical setting produces an abundance of delicious, exotic fruit and vegetables. Everything from scorching hot Thai pik-kee-nu chilies to ultra flavorful pineapple and bananas, it's all there. With long sunny days and tropical rains this abundance is harvested year round. Papaya and other tropical fruit grow wild and delicate orchids thrive in the nearby teak forests gracing the mountain border between Thailand and Burma (just one or two kilometers away).
      Thaworn's uncle was a true gourmet and Thaworn would often accompany him on trips to the markets, and farms and even out into the jungle to collect exotic mushrooms, wild vegetables, herbs and spices. Thaworn's family home was right on the beach facing the Gulf of Thailand (with a large fresh water stream a little behind the house). Wonderful fish, crab, giant squid, and many varieties of shellfish were always on the table.
      Thaworn came to the United States in 1979 and apprenticed under another  uncle who had opened one of the first Thai restaurants in this country.  During that time Eraworn was a favorite of many top actors and actresses who were fond of visiting the kitchen and seeing how things are done.  Later,  Thaworn polished her craft in some of the top Thai restaurants in Los Angeles, including the highly regarded Chao Praya restaurant in Hollywood, Vim in L. A.,  and Thailandia in Burbank, California. ",

      Like many of the chefs who stumble their way into the business, Terry Koval began his restaurant career at the age of 15, working as a dishwasher at John Paul’s Armadillo Oil Company in Greenville, South Carolina. Rather than head to culinary school after those classically sudsy beginnings, Koval looked west to San Francisco, in hopes like many teenagers, of becoming a skateboarder. And it was on the west coast that he had his first introduction to local, seasonal produce and farm-to-table cuisine.
      When the skateboarding career he hoped for didn’t work out, Koval came back to the South, refreshed and inspired by the west coast’s culinary prosperity. He worked his way up the Georgia culinary food chain to the position of executive sous chef under mentor Chef Gary Mennie at nationally acclaimed Canoe in Vinings. He later joined Concentrics Restaurants as the sous chef of Lobby at TWELVE and became executive chef of Room at TWELVE, which was awarded a three-star review from The Atlanta Journal-Constitutionunder his tenure.
      Koval eventually returned to his roots in sustainable cuisine with his expertly crafted, seasonal grass-fed burgers at Burger Burglar. It may be burgers, but Koval understands the importance of refined, fresh flavors, no matter what the vessel. As one of the 2012 Atlanta Rising Stars, he has big plans to return to the finer side of dining in the near future.

      Since making Raleigh her home, Ashley Christensen has sought to foster community through food, philanthropy and the stimulation of the city’s downtown neighborhood.
      Ashley began cooking while in college, throwing dinner parties for her friends and family. These intimate gatherings helped her recognize her passion for cooking and sharing food, and ultimately led to her first professional cooking job at the age of 21. Upon taking the position, she knew she had found her life’s work.
      After working in some of the Triangle’s top kitchens, Ashley opened a diner in 2007, which takes its name and décor from the building’s original tenant—one of downtown Raleigh’s first restaurants.

Seemingly born with a ladle in her hand, she started her culinary journey in her homeland of India, where she graduated at the top of her class at the Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration, India's top culinary and hotel management school. After interning at India's finest hotels and kitchens, including names like the Taj Group, Oberoi Hotels and Le Meridian, it was off to the U.S., where she attended The Culinary Institute of America and graduated with high honors, sweeping all awards in her class. After some valuable fine-dining field experience on the East Coast, it was time to conquer Chicago. This task began with her being the only woman to go up against 40 male chefs for an executive chef position. Once again successful, Chef Chauhan was ultimately the opening chef of Vermilion restaurant. As executive chef of Vermilion, she was at the helm of executing the Indian-Latin cuisine developed by Rohini Dey and her kitchen teams in New York and Chicago. With Chef Chauhan at the helm, the restaurant earned many accolades, including Chicago magazine's Best New Restaurant, Esquire's Restaurant of the Month and Wine Enthusiast's Best New Restaurant in the U.S. Vermilion then set its sights on New York City and launched an equally impressive outpost in the heart of Manhattan. Soon after its doors opened, Chef Chauhan was nominated as the Best Import to New York by Time Out magazine.",

A native of Bombay, India, Vikram Sunderam began his career in 1985 when he joined the Taj Mahal Hotel group. During his training with the company, he worked at several of their properties, including Riverview Lodge where he was promoted to Head Chef. Sunderam received an Advanced Food Hygiene Certificate from Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London and prior to that he earned a Bachelors of Arts degree from Osmania University (Hyderabad) and Diploma in Hotel Administration and Food Technology from Sophia Polytechnic in Bombay. Before making the leap to Washington, Sunderam was at the award-winning Bombay Brasserie in London for 14 years, eight of which he served as the executive chef. During his tenure at Bombay Brasserie, Sunderam also gained experience cooking for large scale, high profile events. Sunderam joined Washington restaurateur Ashok Bajaj in December 2005 to open the140-seat Indian hot spot Rasika. The name Rasikais derived from Sanskrit meaning “flavors” and Chef Vikram Sunderam continues to please critics, celebrities and patrons with his authentic Indian fare with modern flair. His culinary artistry garnered him a nomination for “Best Chef, Mid-Atlantic” by James Beard Foundation in 2009, 2010, and 2012 and a “Chef of the Year” nomination by Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington in 2009 and 2010. In 2007, Tom Sietsema of The Washington Post awarded Rasikawith three and a half stars, calling Rasika “one of the most exciting Indian restaurants on the East Coast.” Among its many accolades, Rasika has gone on to receive “Four Stars” from The Washington Post in the 2009 and 2010 Dining Guide. The restaurant was awarded the number eight spot of the 100 Best Restaurants in Washingtonian magazine in 2010. Sunderam is also collaborating with Bajaj on the recipes for Rasika’s new line of Indian sauces, currently for sale at the restaurant as well as Giant and Whole Foods. He currently resides in McLean, Virginia with his wife and two children.
